CGI/Application/Plugin/BREAD version 0.10
=========================================

Welcome to CGI::Application::Plugin::BREAD!

BREAD is yet another acronym: (B)rowse, (R)ead, (E)dit,
(A)dd and (D)elete.

We built this plugin to showcase the power of CGI::Application
as well as provide the developer with an extremely easy-to-use
module that will provide a database management system in no time.

This release is "alpha" - please do not use this in a production
environment until we reach version 1.0.  This release is meant
to gather feedback and keep our momentum going.

Thanks for giving us a shot!
